-- This file defines the product functor from the product category C×C to C.
-- In order for it to exist, C must be a category with binary products (ie., 
-- the product of any two objects c and d in C, c×d, must exist).
--
-- It maps each object ⟨c, d⟩ in C×C to the product object in C c×d.
-- It also maps each morphism ⟨f, g⟩ in C×C with f : hom_C(c, d) and
-- g : hom_C(i, j), to the morphism f×g : hom_C(c×i, d×j) that makes the
-- diagram commute:
--       c ←   c×i   → i
--              |
--     f ↓  f×g |    ↓ g
--              ↓
--       d ←   d×j   → j

-- Definition for the product functor.
