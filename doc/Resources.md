### Blogposts
[Tai-Danae Bradley's blog][math3ma] - nice explanations for why we need different concepts, not that rigorous, nicely illustrated  
[Bartosz Milewski's series of posts][bartosz_b] - also covered in the [videos][bartosz_v], examples in Haskell, also available as a [book](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf)
