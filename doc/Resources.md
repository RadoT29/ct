## Category theory
### Sites
[nLab wiki][nlab] - contains definitions, examples, etc. for many concepts and applications; also has a list of references and further readings  
[ProofWiki][proof] - has (some) definitions and proofs, also includes sources

### Blogposts
[Tai-Danae Bradley's blog][math3ma] - nice explanations for why we need different concepts, not that rigorous, nicely illustrated  
[Bartosz Milewski's series of posts][bartosz_b] - also covered in the [videos][bartosz_v], examples in Haskell, also available as a [book](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf)
